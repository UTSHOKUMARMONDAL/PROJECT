**Etymology:**
The name "Sherpur" has historical roots. During the time of Emperor Akbar, the area was known as "Dash Kahonia Baju," with Daskahonia now being the name of a village in the 2 no Charsherpur union. The region was situated along the Louhitto Sagar, the previous name of the Brahmaputra River in the area, where people had to pay 10 kahon coins as an annual tax for traveling in the river. "Dash" means ten, and "Kahon" is a unit of measure, equivalent to 128 pieces. Hence, the area became known as "Dash Kahonia."

During the Nawabi period in Bangla, the last landlord of the Gazi clan, Sher Ali Gazi, occupied and ruled the area independently. Consequently, the name of the region changed from "Dash Kahonia" to Sherpur, named after the ruler, Sher Ali Gazi.
