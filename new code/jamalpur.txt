Jamalpur (Bengali: জামালপুর) is a district in Bangladesh,[3] part of the Mymensingh Division. It was established in 1978.[3]

Geography
Jamalpur occupies 2031.98 km2.[3] It is located between 24°34' and 25°26' North and between 89°40' and 90°12' East. It shares an international border with the Indian state of Meghalaya in the North East. It is surrounded by Kurigram and Sherpur districts in the North, Tangail district in the South, Mymensingh and Sherpur districts in the East, Jamuna River, Bogra, Sirajganj and Gaibandha districts in the West. The main town is situated on the bank of the river Brahmaputra, 140 kilometres (87 mi) north of Dhaka, the national capital.

Main rivers and bodies of water include the Old Brahmaputra, Banar River, Kaiser Beel, and Kaludaga Lake.[3]

History
The most notable historical events include the Fakir-Sannyasi Rebellion (1772-1790), the Indigo Resistance Movement (1829), Famine (1874), the advent of rail transport (1899), and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.[3]

War of Liberation
On June 21, 1971, the Pakistani army, in collaboration with the local Razakars, killed 9 people at the Shashan Ghat (cremation center) at Jamalpur Sadar Upazila on the bank of the Brahmaputra. Bengali fighters and the Pakistani army on July 31 fought at Kamalpur Pakistani Army Base of Bakshiganj Upazila, with heavy losses to the occupation army. In this battle, 35 freedom fighters including Capt. Salauddin Mumtaz, Ahaduzzaman, Abul Kalam Azad were killed. A battle was fought between Bengali troops under Sector Commander Colonel Abu Taher and the Pakistani army on November 13 at Kamalpur of Bakshiganj Upazila. Taher was seriously wounded.[3]

The small Pakistani military base at Kamalpur fell on December 4, following a heavy attack by rebels lasting 21 days. In this battle, 220 Pakistani soldiers under the command of Captain Ahsan Malik surrendered.[3]

The Jamalpur garrison was commanded by Sultan Ahmed. He earned renown among the Pakistanis when he refused to surrender to the Indian commander, Hardev Kler, telling him to use a sten, not a pen.[4] This front, together with the Rangpur-Bogra front further west, was the only front where Pakistani troops held out during the war. However, on December 10, 1971, they were ordered to withdraw to Dhaka. During this retreat their commander Abdul-Qadir Niazi fell into enemy custody, giving the Bangladeshis and Indians a morale boost.[citation needed]

Economy
Jamalpur is a market center for local rice, sugarcane, jute, tobacco and mustard. The town's main exports are jute, tobacco, mustard seed, peanut, leather, egg, pulse, betel leaf, and handicrafts. Making nakshi kantha (embroidered quilts) is a traditional occupation. An economic zone is established in Jamalpur by BEZA. The objective of this project is to attract foreign and local investment to industrialize the country for export promotion and to meet the requirements of local areas that lead to employment generation and economic development of the country.

The district is connected by road, rail, and river with Dhaka and the rest of the country.[5] It has a railway station and three Dak bungalows.
